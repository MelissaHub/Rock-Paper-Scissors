# Takehome / Rock Paper Scissors
-------
There was a review pack for understanding arrays, functions and other Syntax concepts.
I also followed the steps to make a rok paper scissors verses user and computer, but simply set it to randomize itself with the guide of this site:

## Prereq / Process

## You will need 

1. Visual code studio (node terminal)

2. link above

3. review code

I simply workied on the review list with many things stumpting me and left to intepretation. As for the Rock paper scissors it wasn't too difficult. Simply used functions UserPlay and Computer play to randomize where playround determines the winner and looser with function Playround wiht a If IFELSE statemnet.
